# 🔢 C++ Number Systems Conversion Projects

This repository contains C++ projects dedicated to converting between different **number systems**, including:
- Decimal ↔ Binary  
- Decimal ↔ Octal  
- Decimal ↔ Hexadecimal  
- Binary ↔ Decimal / Octal / Hex  
- And more conversion algorithms  

These programs are essential for understanding **computer architecture, digital logic, and low-level data representation**.
